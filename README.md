### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer looking for my next opportunity. I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment. 

Problem solving has always been at the heart of everything I do. During my six years in the arts I learnt to find creative solutions for numerous requests, ranging from self-learning HTML and CSS to customise websites, to debugging audiovisual technologies for immersive art installations. Earlier this year I decided to take the plunge into coding after many years of interest in tech and self-guided evenings at home learning JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since. 

Iâ€™m now hugely passionate about building fullstack applications, collaborating with other developers, learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing my knowledge. I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and canâ€™t wait to contribute value to a development team!

------------

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Building my first mobile app, using React Native on the frontend and .NET on the backend! I'm excited to dive into these new technologies. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
My final group project at Dev Academy! I had a blast collaborating with my team, and embraced the struggle of stretching my knowledge even further with Auth0, Multer, and many-to-many relational databases. 

### âš¡ Fun fact
I once got to swim with seals out at Tutukaka - I can confirm they play just like dogs!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software and iOS developer looking for my next opportunity. In 2023 I graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment, and I recently completed an internship at Trade Me where I worked on B2B fullstack software within Jobs. 

Problem solving has always been at the heart of everything I do. During my six years in the arts I learnt to find creative solutions for numerous requests, ranging from self-learning HTML and CSS to customise websites, to debugging audiovisual technologies for immersive art installations. In 2023 I decided to take the plunge into coding after many years of interest in tech and self-guided evenings at home learning JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since. 

Iâ€™m now hugely passionate about building fullstack and mobile applications, collaborating with other developers, learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing my knowledge. I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and canâ€™t wait to contribute value to a development team!

------------

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Building my first iOS app using Swift on the frontend and .NET on the backend! I'm excited to dive into these new technologies. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
My recent internship! It was amazing to work at Trade Me and I learned tons about working with Microsoft .NET Core and TypeScript in an object oriented way. 

### âš¡ Fun fact
I once got to swim with seals out at Tutukaka - I can confirm they play just like dogs!
